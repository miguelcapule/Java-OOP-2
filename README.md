Java is a flexible and popular programming language that supports the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). A programming paradigm known as object-oriented programming makes use of objects, which are instances of classes, to represent and control data and behavior. Java is a strong and adaptable language for creating sophisticated software systems because to its OOP characteristics.

Overloading Constructors - is a technique in Java where you define multiple constructors for a class, each with a different parameter list. This allows you to create objects with different sets of initial values or provide flexibility when initializing objects of the class. When you overload constructors, you can have multiple ways to create objects of the same class with different initialization options.


Inheritance - is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming, and in Java, the extends keyword is used to establish an inheritance relationship between classes. Inheritance allows a class (called the subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class (called the superclass or base class). This promotes code reuse and the creation of more specialized classes that build upon existing ones.

Polymorphism - is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) and a key feature of the Java programming language. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, and it enables method overriding and dynamic method dispatch. 

Abstraction is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is supported by the Java programming language. Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have, while hiding unnecessary details. In Java, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.
